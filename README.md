My personal website in OOP PHP

This is source code for my website hosted live at http://alois-seckar.cz/

It also contains images and media content (except for 3 .ZIP files with music albums) and SQL database export (2015-12-10)

System is written in PHP using OOP and simplified MVC principles.

I am planning regular updates and improvements.

Last major update is v.3.0 from 2015-12-10
