Personal homepage in OOP


This is source code for my website hosted live at http://alois-seckar.cz/

It also contains images and media content (except for .ZIP files with programs music albums) and SQL database export (updated 2015-12-19)

System is written in PHP using OOP and simplified MVC principles.

I am planning regular updates and improvements.
